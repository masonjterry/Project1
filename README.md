# StreetTron

### The goal of StreetTron is to cover as much area in 60 seconds.
#### StreetTron uses your location to track and calculate your area. Every 5 seconds a pin is dropped at your current location. At the end of 60 seconds, you area is calculated.

#### I worked on this project with Carlos Gutier and Chris Platt.

#### We used Google Maps API and OpenWeather API.
#### We used Bootstrap to make the game mobile reponsive.
#### We used Firebase to store the high scores.
